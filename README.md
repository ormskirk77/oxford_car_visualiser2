# Oxford Radar RobotCar LiDAR visualiser
This is a project to visualise LiDAR data from the Oxford RobotCar dataset. See the GitHub page from one of their team from where I got the data from [RobotCar Dataset](https://dbarnes.github.io/radar-robotcar-dataset/). 

This project was implemented in C++.and OpenGL. There are lots of examples of this being done in Python so I thought I would try something different. The data is loaded from the binary files and not the raw data in the .png files. It is noisy, and has not been cleaned in anyway. These are all things for the future.
